# stock-analysis
Creating new repository called "stock-analysis" per the UNC-CH-DA Week 2-Module 2.2 instructions.

This the UNC Chapel Hill Data Analytics Modlue 2 Challenge repository.

Background: Use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

Instructions: Create a script which loops through the provided Excel workbook of annual stock data. Script should iterate through each stock and output the following in a new set of data tables (either on the same worksheet or a new worksheet):
  *  The ticker symbol
  *  Annual change between stock price of stock on the closing day of the year and the opening day of the same year.
      - NOTE positive changes by highlighting the cell in green, negative changes by highlighting the cell in red.
  *  Percentage change of stock price from opening to closing day of the year
  *  Total volume of stock from opening day to the closing day of the year.
  *  Add additional scripting to track and report in an additional data table, the following:
      -  Greatest % increase
      -  Greatest % decrease
      -  Greates total volume
  *  Ensure the script will iterate and run over each yearly worksheet in the workbook with a single call.
